He was allowed to listen to rock and pop music, however, being introduced to artists including <strong>Billy Idol, Blink-182, Black Sabbath, Fall Out Boy, Megadeth and Panic!</strong> at the Disco through video games such as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and Guitar Hero.</p>
      <p>Higgins was a heavy <strong>drug user</strong> during his childhood and teens. He began drinking <strong>lean in sixth grade and using Percocet and Xanax in 2013.</strong> Higgins additionally smoked cigarettes before quitting in his last year of high school because of health issues.</p>
      <p>He learned to play the <strong>piano at four years old, having been inspired by his mother, Carmella Wallace,</strong> who later began paying for lessons. He then took up the guitar and drums while also playing the trumpet for band class. In his sophomore year of high school, he began <strong>posting songs to SoundCloud</strong> which he recorded on his smartphone. Around this time, Higgins began to take rapping more seriously.</p>

Lil Nas X also wrote on Twitter saying, "so sad how often this is happening lately to young talented rising artists".</p>
     <p>Rapper Ski Mask the Slump God, Higgins' close friend whom he collaborated with on the song "Nuketown", said on Twitter "They keep taking my brothers from me", referring also to best friend and longtime collaborator XXXTentacion, who was shot and killed in June 2018. Lil Yachty, who remixed Higgins' song "All Girls Are the Same" mourned his death by tweeting, "Wow, I cannot believe this. Rip my brother juice world". Lil Uzi Vert, Drake, and the Weeknd also gave their condolences.</p>
     <p>In his song, "Legends"—which was dedicated to XXXTentacion, who was murdered in mid-2018 at age 20, and Lil Peep, who overdosed in late 2017 at age 21—Higgins raps "What's the 27 Club? / We ain't making it past 21".
